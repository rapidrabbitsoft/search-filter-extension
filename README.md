# Search Filter Browser Extension

Exclude unwanted search results from Google or DuckDuckGo search results

## Description

This extension allows the end user to automatically exclude unwanted search results. It can be tedious to reapply the same search filter patterns to each search a user makes, so this extension solves by applying the filter to every search.

Currently this extension works in FireFox and Chrome.
